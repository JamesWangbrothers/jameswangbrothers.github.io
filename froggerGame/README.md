## Basic Functionality

In this game, you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

## Additional Functionality

In addition to the basic functionality, you can add more cool functionality to your game. For example, here are some additional features that you can add:
- **Player selection:** allow the user to select the image for the player character before starting the game. You can use the different character images provided in the images folder (weâ€™ll get to that below).
- **Score:** you can implement a score for the game. For example, the score can increase each time the player reaches the water, and it can be reset to 0 when collision occurs (or it can be reduced).
- **Collectables:** you can add gems to the game, allowing the player to collect them to make the game more interesting.
Anything else you like!

## Adding extra functions
- **multiple vehicle types:** randomly passing different type of enemies for different speed. 
- **timed games:** calculate and display the time one player spending on one game.
